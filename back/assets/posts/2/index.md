# It&#39;s easy to get caught up in one thing

To be so engrossed in that thing you lose sight of everything and everyone else.

Whenever I talk to my Dad he&#39;s bound to pitch me his latest million dollar idea. Whether it be a backwards facing toilet seat with a TV on the head so he can watch Megyn Kelly eat his hope away or an app that already exists and each time I&#39;m confronted with the thought of &quot;here we go again&quot;. Although his intentions are good and he thinks he&#39;s in the right place these &#39;ideas&#39; never go further than mentioning them to me, and that&#39;s a shame.

I used to think that that the process of creating something went in this order: idea → gather information → build → use. As I start to think of building my own things I find that wow all of the things I would make are most likely being done or being worked on, stages 3 and 4 of that process. Meaning that either they take the longest to do and that&#39;s why you find the majority of products in those stages - being refined and honed in or finished and available. Or maybe it&#39;s just the opposite, maybe gathering information and coming up with the idea is what takes the longest.

Whenever I&#39;m programming I&#39;m constantly asking myself &#39;I wonder if \_\_\_\_\_ exists&#39; or &#39;I wonder if \_\_\_\_\_ can do \_\_\_\_\_&#39;. It&#39;s the constant confusion and exposure to new things that raises questions. It&#39;s why employees don&#39;t see the major flaws in their process and why my Dad doesn&#39;t see that his ideas are in fact shit. They&#39;ve stopped exploring, and stopped asking questions, the input that they&#39;re receiving is what it has always been.

So I&#39;d like to challenge the idea that someone is picking up Dog shit(wow he sure does use shit a lot) and thinks of a revolutionary pooper scooper that has a febreeze bottle spraying out of the end. Sure these things do happen, and they&#39;re often family supporting inventions. I want to speak to the things that are industry changing. These ideas come from the people who have such a breadth of knowledge in their field that it&#39;s often difficult to even to debate them in conversation. gather information → idea → build → use, rearranging my previous idea flow and stating that it&#39;s really the first that people should concern them selves with. After all my Dad surely would have never thought to turn the seat around on his toilet had he not noticed his elbows go numb after ~7 minutes of leaning on his knees. Gather information, about everything.

The beautiful thing about programming is the blank slate. Whether you&#39;re a veteran in the business or you&#39;re a complete beginner you both are starting in the same spot. It&#39;s also often why too many new people leave and veterans thrive, it&#39;s not because they&#39;re smarter, but because they can relate it to things they already know.

The feeling I have when I stumble upon a stack overflow thread that I know the answer to is one of the most exciting things that I get to experience and I hope others can relate. Not because I get to realize that I know more than someone else, but that I have in fact grown, that no matter how frustrated I get and how glossy my eyes become, the words being thrown at them are sometimes sticking, and that&#39;s inspiring.
